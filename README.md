# Neural-Network
This is a small Project about Neural Networks and Backpropagation I created in School. It uses de MNIST Database to learn how to recognize Handwriting. The whole Neural Network was built up from scratch in Delphi 10.2 with no external libraries. The Implementation still needs to get tweaked at some points, for example that the Network stops if itâ€™s just memorizing the input data, or that its automatically calculates the validation accuracy. But all in all, its works and was done and took about 2 weeks of reading through complicated mathematical explanations and implementing it in the probably one of the most inappropriate programming language for this problem. But it was an educational project so who cares.
